Teleport Just-in-Time Access Requests allow any user to request access to
a resource or role depending on need. The request can then be approved or
denied based on a configurable number of approvers.

Just-in-Time Access Requests are a powerful way to implement the principle of
least privilege in your organization, leaving an attacker with no permanent
admins to target. Users receive elevated privileges for a limited period of
time. And aside from their reviewer privileges, users who review requests can
have limited access to cluster resources.

Just-in-Time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Open-source Teleport users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full Access Request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

## Resource Access Requests

With Resource Access Requests, engineers can easily get access to only the
individual resources they need, when they need it.

[Get started with Resource Access Requests](./access-requests/resource-requests.mdx).

## Role Access Requests

Role Access Requests balance security and flexibility. Engineers can request
temporary credentials with elevated roles in order to perform critical
system-wide tasks.
